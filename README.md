# React Todo App.
A complete todo application with all features.

## Project Description
Build a basic to-do list application using React. The app should allow users to:
1. Add new tasks: Users should be able to enter a task description and add it to the list.
2. Mark tasks as complete: Users should be able to mark completed tasks as "done."
3. Delete tasks: Users should be able to remove tasks from the list.
Requirements:
● UI: A simple and intuitive user interface with a list of tasks and buttons for adding,
marking as complete, and deleting.
● State Management: Use React's built-in state or a state management library like Redux
to store and manage the list of tasks.
● Functionality: Implement the core features of adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
Additional Considerations:
● Styling: Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI) to style the app.
● Error Handling: Consider adding error handling for invalid input or unexpected
scenario
